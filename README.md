Object Oriented Programming
=============================
There were to distinct parts to this exercise.
In the first part, we made play with the different method types.
The second part was a little more complicated. We wrote code that allows you to move a virtual rover around a plateau.
The challenges presented included getting input from the user whether they wanted to turn or move the rover. Once we 
get that input, the rover needs to know where the rover is on the grid and in which direction it is faced. Once the
user finishes their turn, they receive an output giving the coordinates on the grid where the rover is located and
in which direction it is looking.
